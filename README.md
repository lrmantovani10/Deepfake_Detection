# Deepfake Detection Project
I recently embarked on a personal side project (soon to be posted to my GitHub) to detect whether an image posted online is a deepfake or not. To do so, I created a two-step model inspired by this paper: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Deep-Fake-Image-Detection-Based-on-Pairwise-Hsu-Zhuang/5598872d32fd15e367584eb99c07ae79f794243e. The first part of the model is a Siamese network to detect similarity between real and fake images, and the second is a convolutional neural network with a binary classifier. Despite the accomplishments of the paper, the model proposed was excessively large, and the hyperparameters were not supported by my hardware limitations, so I had to decrease the batch size and shift from a "batch all" to a "batch hard" strategy when calculating the triplet loss to make better use of the data provided. Furthermore, believing that I could optimize the model even harder, I used an image preprocessing strategy adopted by the winners of the famous Facebook Deepfake Detection Challenge that involved using OpenCV to draw facial features that help the model discern significant differences between real and deepfake components of the face, such as nose and eyes.
